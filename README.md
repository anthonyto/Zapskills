# Zapskills

## Setup

### RVM

Clone repository onto a desired location on your machine

The application uses Ruby on Rails. We use RVM to manage our Rubies and gemsets. Go ahead and install rvm at rvm.io.

Once you've installed RVM, then run 

`$ rvm install 2.2.0` 

to install ruby 2.2.0, Then run 

'$ rvm gemset create zapskills`  

to create a gemset named zapskills. You'll see in the root of the app directory the two files names .ruby-gemset and .ruby-version expect these configurations. 

Once RVM and the gemset is set up, run `$ bundle install` to download all gems. 

### Database

Ensure that the settings in database.yml match your local mysql settings. 

`$ rake db:create` to create the databases.

`$ rake db:setup` to set up the schemas and seed the databases.

### Running

Run `$ rails s` to turn on your local server and see the webapp at localhost:3000. 

Alternatively, visit zapskills.herokuapp.com to see the app in production, which is a clone of the master branch. 

### Testing

To run all tests: `$ bundle exec rspec`
